	/// A purchase order (PO) is a commercial document issued by a buyer to a seller, 
	/// indicating the type, quantities and agreed prices for products or services the 
	/// seller will provide to the buyer. Sending a PO to a supplier constitutes a legal 
	/// offer to buy products or services. Acceptance of a PO by a seller usually forms a 
	/// once-off contract between the buyer and seller so no contract exists until the PO is accepted.
